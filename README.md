Illustration of computer formalization of mathematics.

In contrast to the philosophy of Mathlib, we do not push to the highest level of generality in the examples. For instance, a theorem is stated for real numbers, even though the statement holds for modules over commutative ring. This is more in tune with the approach in ["Mechanics of Proof"]([https://pages.github.com/](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/)) by Heather Macbeth. However, we will not use any tailor-made tactics. All programs should be compilable in the online LEAN server.
