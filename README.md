In contrast to the philosophy of Mathlib, we do not push to the highest level of generality in the examples. For instance, a theorem is stated for real numbers, even though the statement holds for modules over commutative ring. This is more in tune with the approach in "Mechanics of Proof" by Heather Macbeth. However, we will not use any tailor-made tactics. All programs should be compilable in the online LEAN server.
